# üöÄ My C# Learning Journey (from a JavaScript Perspective)

Welcome to my C# learning journey! This repository contains my code, projects, and notes as I follow along with the 
[Foundational C# with Microsoft](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/foundational-c-sharp-with-microsoft/) course on freeCodeCamp.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìö **Course Overview**
The course teaches the basics of C# programming, including:
1. Variables, Data Types, and Control Flow
2. Methods and Parameters
3. Conditional Logic with If-Else Statements
4. Loops and Collections
5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics
6. Practical Applications and Small Projects

### What I've Learned So Far
- **Variables, Data Types, and Control Flow**: I learned how to use variables and data types effectively, including strings, integers, and booleans, to manage program flow.
- **Methods and Parameters**: Writing reusable code using methods, passing parameters, and returning values.
- **Conditional Logic**: Mastering `if`, `else`, and `else if` statements to implement decision-making.
- **Boolean Expressions and Conditional Operators**: Understanding logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) and using the ternary operator (`?:`) for concise decision-making.
- **Loops and Iteration**: Learning the fundamentals of loops, including `for` and `foreach`, to iterate over arrays and collections.
- **Code Comments and Styling**: Writing clear comments and adhering to C# styling and formatting conventions for readability and maintainability.
